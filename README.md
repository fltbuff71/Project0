**# Project 0**

Web Programming with Python and JavaScript


BACKGROUND:
Hello, My name is Robert W. Higgins Sr.   I am a retired IT Technical Manager.

Currently, I run a part-time PC Help business in central Florida



PROJECT0:
I have created a WEB page that will assist users in managing their computers and avoid scams, called "PCSMART Guide".

The guide is not complete in content yet, but I thought it would be a great opportunity to use my CS50 Web Programming with Python and JavaScript course skills to eventually build this into a fully functional WEB based support tool, which I may offer on a WEB site and allow users to donate (via PayPal) to support the use of and development of the site.

It will be a very robust user friendly tool that will include loads of documentation, freeware links, and WINDOWS scripts, tutorials etc., that the average end user can run on their own in a structurally prompted manner.  This concept will prevent users from installing vendor $$$ software that claim to clean system but in my experience have seen these systems can actually infect the users computer, sometimes on a time delayed basis, so the user does not suspect their newly installed software is the culprit

Using this tool, end users will not have to be a computer geek to properly maintain and fix common computer issues themselves.

In order to focus on course content rather than website content while preparing my webpage, I first developed a prototype in Microsoft WORD.
From that prototype, I manually created all of HTML code to fully satisfy all PROJECT0 course requirements.

The main Menu page  **"PCSMART GUIDE"** is the main page for my **PCSMART GUIDE** application


Sub-Pages include:

    Explains documents various Windows and external processes:

          Backup & Restore
                List tools used in backup and recovery of system and user data.
          Fine-Tuning
               Provide various tools to improve system performance
          Virus Scanning Tools
               Documents proven virus detection and removal tools
          System Recovery Options
               Determine and advise actions based on failure or issue

   To be added at a **later** date,
         -For simplicity, provide User scripts that can be executed to automate complicated tasks
         -Windows "how to" screen recordings of exact steps needed to execute each action
         -a flowcharted diagram of what **next steps** are needed to be done based upon event
