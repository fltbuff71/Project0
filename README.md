**# Project 0**

Web Programming with Python and JavaScript


BACKGROUND:
Hello, My name is Robert W. Higgins Sr.   I am a retired IT Technical Manager.

Currently, I run a part-time PC Help business in central Florida



PROJECT0:
First off, I would just like to say how organized this course is.  Very enjoyable to go through at my own pace.  Documentation of files and lecture materials was OUTSTANDING.  

Thank you !

I have created a WEB page that will assist users in managing their computers and avoid scams, called "PCSMART Guide".

The guide is nowhere complete in content yet, but I thought it would be a great opportunity to use my CS50 Web Programming with Python and JavaScript course skills to eventually build this into a fully functional WEB based support tool, which I may offer on a WEB site and allow users to donate (via PayPal) to support the use of and development of the site.

It will be a very robust user friendly tool that will include loads of documentation, freeware links, and WINDOWS scripts, tutorials etc., that the average end user can run on their own in a structurally prompted manner.  This concept will prevent users from installing $$$ vendor software that claim to clean system, but in my experience, have seen these systems can actually infect the users computer, sometimes on a time delayed basis, so the user does not suspect their newly installed software is the culprit

Using this my final TOOL (DOWN THE ROAD), end users will not have to be a computer geek to properly maintain and fix common computer issues themselves.

In order to focus on course content rather than website content while preparing my webpage, I first developed a prototype in Microsoft WORD.
From that prototype, I manually created all of HTML code to fully satisfy all PROJECT0 course requirements.
and
I actually used some of this code and embedded it into my WEEBLY.com website www.pc-smart.weebly.com, which will EVENTUALLY be my final WEBSITE.

The main Menu page  **"PCSMART GUIDE"** is the main page.

While the pages themselves may not be the "best" designed for appearance or functionality, 
I tried to make sure I was **satisfying** all of the project0 requirements in coding these pages.


Sub-Pages include:
    Explains documents various Windows and external processes:
          Backup & Restore
                List tools used in backup and recovery of system and user data.
          Fine-Tuning
               Provide various tools to improve system performance
          Virus Scanning Tools
               Documents proven virus detection and removal tools
          System Recovery Options
               Determine and advise actions based on failure or issue
          Test BootStrap
               For simplicity I just created another page to exhibit Bootstrap component anc column features
          Test Inheritance Nesting and Variables
               For simplicity I just created another page to exhibit Inheritance Nesting and Variables uses in my WebPage

============================================================================================================================
DOCUMENTATION Included that I used for my project work:
    Project0 Requirements.doc   (I used this to make sure I was checking off the boxes on each requirement)
  
    I created the .bat files listed  below to be able to easily repeat these processes
    add file to git.bat
    commit to git.bat
    git push.bat
    SAS compile Inheritance 
    SAS compile Nesting
    SAS compile Variables

Also, after finally getting SUBMIT50 to get installed (had to google solution to get to work under Debian)
Here's what I did to finally get something working:


latest python3.8
install debian
sudo apt update
install pip3  (sudo apt install python3-pip)
sudo apt install git3-all
    pip3 install submit50
then ....
   Close the Debian window and reopen (important - if you don't do this, then running 'submit50' will say "Command not found").
   Now you can run submit50 in the Debian window - 
   note it will be installed in this Debian Linux environment only and therefore cannot be run outside of it (i.e. it    cannot be run in a Windows command prompt).

In order to submit your assignment, you have to be in the directory where your assignment is located.  
I did the following....

In Windows, sign on to GITHUB as fltbuff71...
then ...
fltbuff71@DESKTOP-N1PGFEA:/$ cd /
fltbuff71@DESKTOP-N1PGFEA:/$ cd ls
fltbuff71@DESKTOP-N1PGFEA:/$ cd mnt/c/users/fltbu/documents/harvard/project0
fltbuff71@DESKTOP-N1PGFEA:/mnt/c/users/fltbu/documents/harvard/project0$     submit50 web50/projects/2020/x/0
